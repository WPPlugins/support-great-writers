Sell Amazon products in sidebar widgets, unique to the individual POST or generically from a default pool of products that you define.

== Description ==

The Amazon Book Store widget gives you a simple way to sell Amazon products in the sidebar of your blog, magazine, or other WordPress-powered website.  The widget can be included multiple times, with different products being displayed in each instance.

You can sell specific products on specific pages of your website, or define a 'pool' of products from which the widget will randomly chose.  This allows you to quickly build up an Amazon store of products that are related to your individual POSTs.

== Installation ==

**Install the Widget**

Install the plugin, then activate it.  Once activated, configure the Widget:

* First, drag the 'Amazon Book Store' widget to your sidebar.
* Where prompted, set the "Title" you want displayed above the widget
* Select how many product images you want displayed in the widget, 1 or 2.

**Configure the ASIN pool**

Navigate to 'Settings' -> 'Amazon Book Store'.  Input your Amazon Affiliate ID and country, the add the ASINs for the products you want to be displayed in the widget.  See [How to Find Amazon ASINs](http://askville.amazon.com/find-Amazon-ASIN-product-details-page/AnswerViewer.do?requestId=11106037) for more information.  There are two categorizations of settings:

* POST Specific:  If set, these products will be displayed when users are reading the designated POST.
* Default: If the request is to a POST that does not have specific ASINs defined, then the widget will display products from this group.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I Use This Widget More Than Once In My Sidebar? =
Yes.  Absolutely.  The widget will keep track of which products have already been displayed on the page and will ensure that duplicates are not shown.
